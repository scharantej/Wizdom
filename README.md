 ## Problem Analysis

The problem is to build a visual tutoring website. The website should allow students to learn new concepts through interactive lessons. The website should also provide a way for students to interact with each other and with their teachers.

## Design

The design for the website will be a Flask application. Flask is a Python microframework that is well-suited for building web applications. The application will consist of the following HTML files:

* `index.html`: The home page of the website. This page will contain a list of all the lessons that are available.
* `lesson.html`: A page that displays a single lesson. This page will contain the content of the lesson, as well as a way for students to interact with the lesson.
* `quiz.html`: A page that displays a quiz for a particular lesson. This page will contain a list of questions, as well as a way for students to submit their answers.
* `results.html`: A page that displays the results of a quiz. This page will contain a list of the questions that the student answered correctly and incorrectly.

The application will also have the following routes:

* `/`: The home page of the website.
* `/lesson/<lesson_id>`: A route that displays a single lesson.
* `/quiz/<lesson_id>`: A route that displays a quiz for a particular lesson.
* `/results/<lesson_id>`: A route that displays the results of a quiz.

## Implementation

The implementation of the website will be done in Python. The following libraries will be used:

* Flask: A Python microframework for building web applications.
* Jinja2: A Python templating engine.
* SQLAlchemy: A Python ORM for interacting with databases.

The application will be deployed to a Heroku server.

## Testing

The website will be tested using the following methods:

* Unit tests: Unit tests will be written for each of the routes in the application.
* Integration tests: Integration tests will be written to test the interaction between the different components of the application.
* Functional tests: Functional tests will be written to test the overall functionality of the application.

## Deployment

The application will be deployed to a Heroku server. Heroku is a cloud platform that provides a simple way to deploy and manage web applications.

## Conclusion

The visual tutoring website will provide students with a new and engaging way to learn. The website will be easy to use and will provide students with a variety of interactive lessons. The website will also provide a way for students to interact with each other and with their teachers.
